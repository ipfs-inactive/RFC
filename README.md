*This IPFS-related repository has been archived, and all issues are therefore frozen.* If you want to ask a question or open/continue a discussion related to this repo, please visit the [official IPFS forums](https://discuss.ipfs.io).

We archive repos for one or more of the following reasons:
- Code or content is unmaintained, and therefore might be broken
- Content is outdated, and therefore may mislead readers
- Code or content evolved into something else and/or has lived on in a different place
- The repository or project is not active in general

Please note that in order to keep the primary IPFS GitHub org tidy, most archived repos are moved into the [ipfs-inactive](https://github.com/ipfs-inactive) org.

If you feel this repo should **not** be archived (or portions of it should be moved to a non-archived repo), please [reach out](https://ipfs.io/help) and let us know. Archiving can always be reversed if needed.


IPFS RFCs
=====

This repository was originally imagined as a place where people propose, comment on, and refer to RFCs for changes to IPFS and its surrounding projects - however it was later deprecated. See the open PRs for historical thoughts.
