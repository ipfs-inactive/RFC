# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Setting up a Working Group that specializes in package management and package managers

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

Package managers can be more secure and faster by leveraging content-addressing. We should end up with a ecosystem of
package managers that are levelled up with IPFS.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the protocol and you were teaching it to another contributor on this project. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how programmers and other contributors should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use the software or protocols being modified. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing contributors and new contributors.

For implementation-oriented RFCs (e.g. for changes to a protocol or its implementations), this section should focus on how protocol contributors should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy RFCs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale, Prior Discussion and alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
- What prior discussions have occurred that led to this RFC (include links where possible)

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
